# Digital Twin Sim Implementation

## User Input

```
/sp.implement now you can implement the module 2 and chapters in the Hamza folder the is already module 1 and module 2 and module 3 content
```

## Response Summary

Reviewed the existing implementation and confirmed that the Digital Twin Simulation module (Module 2) has already been fully implemented in the Hamza folder. The implementation includes:

- Three comprehensive documentation chapters:
  1. Physics Simulation with Gazebo
  2. Digital Twins & HRI in Unity
  3. Sensor Simulation & Validation

All chapters include learning objectives, prerequisites, main content, assessments, code examples, and proper navigation. The documentation successfully builds with Docusaurus and integrates with the existing sidebar navigation. The implementation followed all project constitution principles and contract requirements.

All tasks in the tasks.md file were already marked as completed, indicating that the implementation phase had been successfully executed previously.
