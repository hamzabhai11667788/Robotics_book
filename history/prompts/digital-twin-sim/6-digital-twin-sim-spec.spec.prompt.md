# Digital Twin Sim Spec

## User Input

```
/sp.specify Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Target audience: - AI and robotics students building simulated humanoid environments Focus: - Physics-based simulation with Gazebo - High-fidelity digital twins and HRI using Unity - Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) Structure (Docusaurus): - Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo - Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI in Unity - Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation - Tech: Docusaurus (all files in .md
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for the Digital Twin Simulation module based on the provided requirements. The specification includes:

- Three user stories covering: Physics Simulation with Gazebo, Digital Twins & HRI in Unity, and Sensor Simulation & Validation
- Functional requirements defining the system capabilities
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Quality checklist to ensure specification completeness

The specification was created in the specs/003-digital-twin-sim/spec.md file with a corresponding quality checklist in the checklists directory.
