# Digital Twin Sim Tasks

## User Input

```
/sp.tasks
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive task list for the Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity) module with 48 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Physics Simulation with Gazebo (10 tasks)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Digital Twins & HRI in Unity (11 tasks)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Sensor Simulation & Validation (11 tasks)
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (8 tasks)

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers where appropriate, and user story labels. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story.
