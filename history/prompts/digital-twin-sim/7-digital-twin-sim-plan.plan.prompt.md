# Digital Twin Sim Plan

## User Input

```
/sp.plan Set up Module-2 in Docasaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations (Physics, environments, sensors) -- All content written as .md files, organized per chapter for easy navigation
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity) module. The plan includes:

- Updated plan.md with technical context and constitution check
- research.md with technology decisions and rationale
- data-model.md defining the documentation structure
- quickstart.md with setup and deployment instructions
- documentation-contract.md specifying the structure and standards
- Updated agent context with new technology stack

All artifacts align with the project constitution principles of spec-first workflow, technical accuracy, clear writing, and reproducible setup.
