# AI Robot Brain Plan

## User Input

```
/sp.plan Set up Module-3 in Docusaurus with structured chapters covering NVIDIA Isaac Sim,
Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid perception and navigation.

- Organize content into 3 chapters (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2)
- Explain AI-driven perception, synthetic data, and VSLAM concepts
- Focus on humanoid navigation and path planning
- Write all content as .md files
- Ensure clear sidebar navigation and module consistency
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) module. The plan includes:

- Updated plan.md with technical context and constitution check
- research.md with technology decisions and rationale
- data-model.md defining the documentation structure
- quickstart.md with setup and deployment instructions
- documentation-contract.md specifying the structure and standards
- Updated agent context with new technology stack

All artifacts align with the project constitution principles of spec-first workflow, technical accuracy, clear writing, and reproducible setup.
