# ROS 2 Humanoid Docs Plan

## User Input

```
/sp.plan  Initialize Docusaurus project, configure sidebar, and set tech stack to Docusaurus; all content files will be written in '.md' Markdown files and register them in Docusaurus docs structure.

Ready for next step: /sp.plan to create the implementation plan for this specification.  sp.plan ka pahla ka kam hata do us prompt k hisan sa content add kro
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics Documentation module. The plan includes:

- Updated plan.md with technical context and constitution check
- research.md with technology decisions and rationale
- data-model.md defining the documentation structure
- quickstart.md with setup and deployment instructions
- documentation-contract.md specifying the structure and standards
- Updated agent context with new technology stack

All artifacts align with the project constitution principles of spec-first workflow, technical accuracy, clear writing, and reproducible setup.
