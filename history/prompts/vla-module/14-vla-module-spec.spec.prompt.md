# VLA Module Spec

## User Input

```
/sp.specify Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Target audience: - AI and robotics students building autonomous humanoid systems Focus: - Integrating LLMs with robotics - Voice-to-action pipelines - Cognitive planning and task execution Structure (Docusaurus): - Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper - Chapter 2: LLM-Based Cognitive Planning for Robotics - Chapter 3: Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid Tech: - Docusaurus (all files in .md)
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module with three user stories:

1. Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper (Priority: P1)
2. LLM-Based Cognitive Planning for Robotics (Priority: P2)
3. Capstone - The Autonomous Humanoid (Priority: P3)

The specification includes detailed user scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and key entities. All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic, with measurable outcomes for each user story. The specification is ready for the planning phase.
